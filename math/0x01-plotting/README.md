| Task | Description | File |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0. Line Graph | Complete the following source code to plot y as a line graph | 0-line.py |
| 1. Scatter | Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y as a scatter plot | 1-scatter.py |
| 2. Change of scale | Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y as a line graph | 2-change_scale.py |
| 3. Two is better than one | Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y1 and x ↦ y2 as line graphs | 3-two.py |
| 4. Frequency | Complete the following source code to plot a histogram of student scores for a project | 4-frequency.py |
| 5. All in One | Complete the following source code to plot all 5 previous graphs in one figure | 5-all_in_one.py |
| 6. Stacking Bars | Complete the following source code to plot a stacked bar graph | 6-bars.py |
| 7. Gradient | Complete the following source code to create a scatter plot of sampled elevations on a mountain | 100-gradient.py |
| 8. PCA | Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a vital procedure used in data science for reducing the dimensionality of data (in turn, decreasing computation cost). It is also largely used for visualizing high dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions. For this task, you will be visualizing the Iris flower data set . You will need to download the file pca.npz to test your code. You do not need to push this dataset to github. Complete the following source code to visualize the data in 3D | 101-pca.py |
